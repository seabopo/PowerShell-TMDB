This module retrieves metadata about TV Shows and Movies from [TMDB (The Movie DB)](https://www.themoviedb.org) 
using their publicly available [API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started).

This module is not a wrapper of the complete TMDB API. It is a READ-ONLY implementation of the functions 
required to apply metadata to local media files.

All content retrieved by this API is the product of The Movie DB (TMDB) and it's community. 
This PowerShell module uses the TMDB API, but is not affiliated with, endorsed by or certified by The Movie DB (TMDB).

The [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) 
is free to use for non-commercial purposes as long as you attribute TMDB as the source of the data and/or images.

To use the [API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) you will need an API key. 
To get an API key, create a free [TMDB Account](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) and request an API key 
from the [API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) section under your account profile.
